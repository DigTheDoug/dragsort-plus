jQuery List DragSort-Plus
======

Based off the original jQuery List DragSort (http://dragsort.codeplex.com), jQuery List DragSort-Plus is a modified version created mainly with a few specific changes in mind:

* Drag and sort lists without moving existing lists items or creating empty templates within the list first. Instead show indicators on surrounding list items when dragged/hovered between them.
* Allow list items to be dropped on one another as well as in between with seperate events.

Made with 2D grid lists in mind such as bootstrap's 'thumbnails'.
